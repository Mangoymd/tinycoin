# Tinycoin

This project is created to learn blockchain by creating a small blockchain and it's own coin. 

# Prerequisite
- Python >= 3.6 

If you are running other python versions, this project can be ported to other python versions with small syntax changes.

# How to run?

- `git clone https://github.com/prakashpandey/tinycoin`

- `cd tinycoin`

#### '.*NIX' based systems

- `./start.sh`

#### Windows system

- set `HOST`, `PORT`, `PEERS` and `MINER_ADDRESS` environment variables. 
  Follow `Configuration` section for more details.

- python src/app.py

By default the application will run on port `5000`


# Configuration

Open file `start.sh`. 
You can set the values of following environment variables according to your needs.

- `HOST="http://127.0.0.1"`

- `PORT=5000`

- `PEERS="http://192.168.1.11:5000,http://192.168.1.12:5000"`

- `MINER_ADDRESS="ppdpp-dvfgf-fredgdsdf-gdsfgsd-35vr433-ee2eass4d"`
